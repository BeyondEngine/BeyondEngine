	\defgroup Reference_Messages Reference Messages 

This section describes some of the common messages used by references and the
meaning of the \ref partids parameter associated with these messages. Some messages are
sent by the system while others are sent by the plugin. Each method may need to 
pass along additional information so the reference maker may process the message.
This information is passed in the \ref partids parameter. The meaning of the 
information stored in the \ref partids is specific to the message sent along with it.

\note Not all messages use the \ref partids parameter (in fact most don't). In 
these cases the \ref partids will be set to 0. If the plugin is sending the message, it
should set the \ref partids to 0 if not used. In the cases where the \ref partids is used, it
is documented below.\n

Developers who define their own reference messages should do so using a value greater than the following:
\code
#define REFMSG_USER 0x00010000
\endcode
The system uses numbers less than this value.

			implementing NotifyRefChanged().
			The plugin developer usually implements this method as a switch 
			statement where each case is one of the messages the plugin needs to
			respond to.
			The Method StdNotifyRefChanged calls this, which can change the 
			partID to new value. If it doesn't depend on the particular message&
			partID, it should return REF_DONTCARE.
		\li For developer that need to update a dialog box with data about 
			an object you reference note the following related to this method: 
			This method may be called many times. For instance, say you have a 
			dialog box that displays data about an object you reference. This 
			method will get called many time during the drag operations on that 
			object. If you updated the display every time you'd wind up with a 
			lot of 'flicker' in the dialog box. Rather than updating the dialog 
			box each time, you should just invalidate the window in response to 
			the NotifyRefChanged() call. Then, as the user drags the mouse your 
			window will still receive paint messages. If the scene is complex 
			the user may have to pause (but not let up on the mouse) to allow 
			the paint message to go through since they have a low priority. This
			is the way many windows in 3ds Max work.

		\param  changeInt - This is the interval of time over which the 
			message is active. Currently, all plug-ins will receive FOREVER for 
			this interval.
		\param  hTarget - This is the handle of the reference target the 
			message was sent by. The reference maker uses this handle to know 
			specifically which reference target sent the message.
		\param  partID - This contains information specific to the message 
			passed in. Some messages don't use the partID at all. See the 
			section List of Reference Messages for more information about the 
			meaning of the partID for some common messages.
		\param  message - The message parameters passed into this method is 
			the specific message which needs to be handled.
		\return The return value from this method is of type RefResult. This is 
			usually REF_SUCCEED indicating the message was processed. Sometimes,
			the return value may be REF_STOP. This return value is used to stop 
			the message from being propagated to the dependents of the item.

//! \brief A callback class for ReferenceMaker::EnumRefHierarchy.
/*! This is the callback object for ReferenceMaker::EnumRefHierarchy. This class's 
	proc() method is called for each element in the reference hierarchy.
	When enumerating indirect references, it is possible to enter an infinite recursive 
	loop unless references are not processed more than once. The system prevents 
	processing duplicates by either maintaining a list of all references processed, 
	or by clearing a flag bit on all references and then testing/setting the flag 
	bit as references are processed. In the ReferenceMaker::EnumRefHierarchy method, 
	this object's BeginEnumeration method is called	before starting an enumeration, 
	and EndEnumeration at the end. These methods increment and decrement an internal
	counter. When the counter is decremented to 0, the list of visited references is
	cleared. This ensures that the list of visited references is maintained during 
	recursive calls to EnumRefHierarchy, but cleared when the outter most call is 
	exited. In some cases however, it is desirable to maintain the list of visited 
	references across	calls to EnumRefHierarchy. In these cases, call this object's 
	BeginEnumeration method prior to the calls to EnumRefHierarchy, and 
	EndEnumeration when done. For example:
\code
	FreeMapsRefEnum freeEnum(this);
	for ( rmaker = <enum over some refmaker set> )
		-- list of visited references cleared after each call
		EnumRefHierarchy(rmaker, freeEnum); 

	versus

	FreeMapsRefEnum freeEnum(this);
	freeEnum.BeginEnumeration()
	for ( rmaker = <enum over some refmaker set> )
		-- list of visited references maintained across each call
		EnumRefHierarchy(rmaker, freeEnum); 
	freeEnum.EndEnumeration()

	this method prior to enumerating the specified reference maker. In some cases

	reference makers visited is maintained. If you expect to enumerate only a small 
	number of references, this argument should be set to false. Note however that 
	you do not know what references are held by the references you may enumerate into, 
	so in most cases this argument should be true. Note that the setting specified
